About CPGIS The International Conference on Geoinformatics is an official conference of the International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS) and has been held annually since 1992. It has attracted not only the CPGIS members but also researchers, professionals, and students from broad communities around the world. The International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS) aims at promoting: (1) the professional development of its members by fostering cooperation among its members and by maintaining a central point of reference and deliberation, (2) the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and scientific development in GIS and related sciences and technologies between Chinese GIS professionals abroad and those in China, (3) an efficient channel between its members and other GIS professionals, through which mutual understanding and cooperation can be enhanced, and (4) education of geographic information sciences at all levels around the world. For more information about CPGIS, please visit www.cpgis.org . About GIS Unit, Department of Geography, NUS The Geographic Information System (GIS) Unit's mission is to be a key node of geographical knowledge production and dissemination, through both teaching and research, within Asia and globally. The Geographic Information System (GIS) Unit of the department seeks to spearhead the use of GIS across the various research disciplines and reach beyond the research realm in order to shape the GIS ecosystem in the campus. This bold mission is achieved through multiple initiatives across research, teaching, administration, operations and enterprise in turn grow the community of Geo-professionals for the university and for the industry.

Full paper submissions A full paper for the Conference Proceedings must follow the format requirements of IEEE. Please use the template of full paper for Conference Proceedings to prepare the submission. The length of such a full paper is 6-8 pages. It is highly recommended that the paper be proofread by an experienced English editor. Papers that do not meet the format and language requirements will not be further reviewed for content. For accepted full papers, authors can choose whether they wanted to publish their full papers in the Conference Proceedings (IEEE Conference Proceedings) or NOT with the conference proceedings, but instead submit them to special issues of international journals associated with the conference. If an author chooses to submit her/his paper to a journal, the paper must follow the format requirements of that particular journal and will go through the regular peer-review process of that journal. Important Notes : For a full paper to be included in the conference proceedings, the author(s) must present it in the Geoinformatics annual conference. Accepted papers not presented by the authors in the conference will not be able to publish with the proceedings. Due to the copyright restriction, the authors can choose to publish, if accepted, their papers either in the Conference Proceedings or a journal, but NOT BOTH.
