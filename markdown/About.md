 

# Geoinformatics 2026

The [GIS Unit](https://nusgis.org/), [Department of Geography, National University of Singapore](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/geog/), welcomes you to the 33rd International Conference on Geoinformatics (**Geoinformatics 2026** ), which will be held between **<u>19-22 July 2026</u>**, at **University Town ([UTown](https://uci.nus.edu.sg/campus-life/campus-services/utown/)), NUS**.

The main theme of 2026 Conference on Geoinformatics is **Geo-Innovations for a Sustainable and Resilient Society**. Under this broad umbrella, the conference aims to engage dialogues between researchers and practitioners to advance theoretical, methodological, and applied aspects of geographic information science and systems that transform our living environment to be more sustainable and more resilient. Other presentations regarding cutting-edge research on or related to broadly defined geographic information sciences, technologies, and applications, are also welcome, as always.

We invite you to organize and get involved in organizing sessions, workshops, and other activities.

# About CPGIS

The International Conference on Geoinformatics is an official conference of the International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS) and has been held annually since 1992. It has attracted not only the CPGIS members but also researchers, professionals, and students from broad communities around the world.

The International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS) aims at promoting: 

(1) the professional development of its members by fostering cooperation among its members and by maintaining a central point of reference and deliberation, 

(2) the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and scientific development in GIS and related sciences and technologies between Chinese GIS professionals abroad and those in China, 

(3) an efficient channel between its members and other GIS professionals, through which mutual understanding and cooperation can be enhanced, and 

(4) education of geographic information sciences at all levels around the world.

# Organisation

## GIS Unit, NUS

(Copied and Modified from nusgis.org)

The Geographic Information System (GIS) Unit's mission is to be a key node of geographical knowledge production and dissemination, through both teaching and research, within Asia and globally. The Geographic Information System (GIS) Unit of the department seeks to spearhead the use of GIS across the various research disciplines and reach beyond the research realm in order to shape the GIS ecosystem in the campus. This bold mission is achieved through multiple initiatives across research, teaching, administration, operations and enterprise in turn grow the community of Geo-professionals for the university and for the industry.
